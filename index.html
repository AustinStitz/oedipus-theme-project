      <h1>Poem - Richard Cory</h1>
      <h3>Richard Cory by Edwin Arlington Robinson</h3>
      <p style="text-align: center"><i>
        Whenever Richard Cory went down town,<br/>
        We people on the pavement looked at him:<br/>
        He was a gentleman from sole to crown,<br/>
        Clean favored, and imperially slim.<br/>
        <br/>
        And he was always quietly arrayed,<br/>
        And he was always human when he talked;<br/>
        But still he fluttered pulses when he said,<br/>
        "Good-morning," and he glittered when he walked.<br/>
        <br/>
        And he was rich—yes, richer than a king—<br/>
        And admirably schooled in every grace:<br/>
        In fine, we thought that he was everything<br/>
        To make us wish that we were in his place.<br/>
        <br/>
        So on we worked, and waited for the light,<br/>
        And went without the meat, and cursed the bread;<br/>
        And Richard Cory, one calm summer night,<br/>
        Went home and put a bullet through his head.<br/>
      </i></p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <p class="desc">The poem "Richard Cory" tells us about a man who seemed to have it
      all together and was envied by many, but had a deeper trouble that nobody
      saw that then led to his suicide. The truth was far beyond what the people
      in the poem saw at first.</p>

      <h1>Quote - Ernest Hemingway</h1>
      <h3 class="desc2"><i>"If a writer knows enough about what he is writing
        about, he may omit things that he knows. The dignity of movement of an
        iceberg is due to only one ninth of it being above water."</i></h3>
        <h3>- Ernest Hemingway</h3>
        <br/>
        <p class="desc2">This quote is the core of Ernest Hemingway's iceberg
        theory where he writes only a small amount of the truth. This quote
        and theory are both largely comparable to how truth works; that you
        only know a part of the truth by what you observe, and that there is
        much more going on in the background.</p>

      <h1>Song - Truth Be Told by Matthew West</h1>
      <iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j4wYkS8Z3Io" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p class = "desc2">The song "Truth Be Told" by Matthew West is entirely
      about how we keep the truth inside and that nothing will be fixed if we keep
      doing that. It is entirely based on how we always only let a small part
      of the truth be known by others, and how the absolute truth is much more
      than what we say. While in <i>Oedipus Rex</i>, Oedipus simply didn't
      know the truth, this song still shows the same theme that truth is deeper
      than what we simply observe.</p>

      <p class = "desc2">This image shows how perception is only the tip of
      the iceberg and that reality goes much deeper than what we observe or
      perceive.</p>

      <p class = "desc2">This image shows the fact that how we see something
        determines how we perceive it. Each person in the picture sees a
        different part of reality, but their perceptions aren't the absolute
        truth due to the other side of the story. The truth is much deeper than
        what one person sees and includes what others see or even what nobody
        sees. </p>

      <h1>Oedipus Quote #1</h1>
      <h3 class="desc2"><i>"For our state, he stood there like a tower against
        death,  and from that moment, Oedipus, we have called you our king and
        honoured you above all other men, the one who rules in mighty Thebes"</i>
        (1436-1441)</h3>
        <br/>
        <p class="desc2">This quote from <i>Oedipus Rex</i> shows the initial
        perception of the people of Thebes regarding Oedipus. Oedipus was highly
        revered among the Theban people and was honored above all others. This
        is what the people saw, but is certainly not the truth, which goes much
        deeper.</p>

      <h1>Oedipus Quote #2</h1>
      <h3 class="desc2"><i>"Poor wretched Oedipus, your fate stands here to
        demonstrate for me how no mortal man is ever blessed"</i>
        (1429-1431)</h3>
        <br/>
        <p class="desc2">This quote from <i>Oedipus Rex</i> shows that Oedipus
        was not blessed as the people of Thebes thought he was. They had seen
        what they had, but did not know the truth for the truth is much deeper
        than what we see. The truth was that Oedipus was cursed from his birth
        to kill his father and marry his mother, but all the Theban people had
        seen before the play began was Oedipus' kingly greatness and heroicness
        and his skill in solving riddles, which he had used to defeat the Sphinx.
        The people thought they had known the truth about Oedipus, but truly did
        not.</p>

      <h1>Oedipus Quote #3</h1>
      <h3 class="desc2"><i>"So while we wait to see that final day, we cannot
        call a mortal being happy before he’s passed beyond life free from pain"</i>
        (1812-1814)</h3>
        <br/>
        <p class="desc2">This quote from <i>Oedipus Rex</i> shows when the
        people of Thebes begin to realize that they could not accurately judge
        Oedipus by what they had known before and that there was much more than
        what they had seen. This quote essentially sums up the entire theme,
        and its placement in the final ode of the play implies that it is also
        a significant intended theme of the play. The chorus at this moment knew
        that the truth was more than what they had seen, and that there was much
        that was known by others that they didn't know and even things that nobody
        knew at the beginning of the play. Ultimately, with this final ode, the
        chorus explains how the truth is much deeper than what we may observe.</p>

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <br/>
      <p class="desc2">That concludes my project! Between the poem "Richard
        Cory," the quote from Ernest Hemingway, the song "Truth Be Told" by
        Matthew West, the two images illustrating the difference between
        perception and reality, and lastly, the three quotes from Oedipus Rex,
        the theme that truth goes much deeper than what we see at first is
        a significant theme shown in some way or another with all of these.</p>
